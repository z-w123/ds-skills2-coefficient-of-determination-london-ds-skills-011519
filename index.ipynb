    "## Introduction\n",
    "For linear regression analysis, as we saw earlier, the straight does not **fully** describe the relationship between variables and there is always some error. In order to determine the \"goodness of fit** of the fitted line, we need some measure to show the predictive performance of the model. In this lesson, we shall look at R<sup>2</sup> (pronounced r squared) as a coefficient of determination for our fitted model.\n",

    "Here is how it works. R-squared uses a baseline model which is the **worst** model. This baseline model does not make use of any independent variables to predict the value of dependent variable Y. Instead it uses the **mean** of the observed responses of dependent variable Y and always predicts this mean as the value of Y. Pretty silly ! well thats why its the WORST model. \n",

    "The red line in the above figure is the baseline model that always predicts mean of Y as the value of Y **irrespective** of the value of the independent variables. The green line is our fitted model which makes use of X values to predict the values of Y. Looking at the plot above , R-squared simply asks the question:\n",

    ">**Can you do better than the baseline ?**\n",

    "Any regression model that we fit is compared to this baseline model to understand it’s **goodness of fit**. Simply put, R-squared just explains how good is your model when compared to the baseline model. Thats about it. "
